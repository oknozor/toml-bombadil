## Switching profile

As we saw Bombadil allows to define a default profile. For some programs you might want to
set an alternate configuration.

Bombadil allow you two do this in several ways :
- overriding a dot entry `source` and/or `target` value.
- adding a new dot entry.
- adding new variables.
- overriding existing variable.
- adding hooks to the profile.
