Toml Bombadil is a dotfile manager written in rust. 

##  Why another dotfile manager ? 

I wrote Toml Bombadil because I kept changing my desktop environment : 
switching from i3 to sway, from sway to xfce, from xfce to gnome and back to sway.
When you keep changing your working environment like this you end up with several problems : 
- Some symlinks will end up orphans. 
- Not every program you use support Xresources and you will most probably have to manually edit some themes/config. 
- When starting a fresh installation you will very likely need to adapt your existing dotfiles to your new machine.
- It is a mess 

Toml Bombadil try to solve this with a simple addition to the symlink method used by other tools : instead of creating 
a symlink from a dotfile to the actual config path of a program, it will create a copy of it and symlink the copy. 
This additional step allow to use your original dotfile as a template and inject variables in the copy. 
You can have multiple value files in the same dotfile repository and change color scheme, or any value on the fly.

In addition this is completely optional, you could start using Toml Bombadil only to generate symlinks and templatize 
your dot file progressively.

## Installation 

### Using [cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/)

```shell script
cargo install toml-bombadil
```

### Archlinux 
```shell script
yay -S bombadil-bin
```

## Getting started

**1. Setup :** 

```shell script
git clone https://github.com/my_org/dotfiles
cd my_dotfiles && touch bombadil.toml
```

If you are using git you might want to add `.dots` to your `.gitignore`. 

**2. Configuration :**

Toml bombadil needs a toml config file, along this readme we will call it `bombadil.toml`. 

```toml
# {dotfiles}/bombadil.toml

# Path to your dotfiles relative to your $HOME directory
dotfiles_dir = "my_dotfiles"
[settings]
# An array of toml files paths containing the variables to inject in your templatize dotfiles
# You can have multiple var files as long as variable names does not colide. 
vars = [ "vars.toml" ]

# An array of post install shell commands
hooks = [ "sway reload" ]
[settings.dots]
# A dot entry representing a symlink, `source` is relative to `dotfiles_dir` 
# and `target` shall be relative to $HOME directory or absolute.
sway = { source = "sway", target = ".config/sway" }
# You can have as many dot entry as you want, linking files or directories
alacritty = { source = "alacritty", target = ".config/alacritty/alacritty.yml" }
```

**3. Linking bombadil :**

For Bombadil to be able to run from any directory and use different config files we need to symlink bombadil config to 
`$XDG_CONFIG_DIR/bombadil.toml` : 

```shell script
bombadil install -c my_dotfiles/bombadil.toml
```

If you want to switch to another config simply run : 
```shell script
bombadil install -c my_dotfiles/bombadil-i3.toml
``` 

**4. Install template and symlink :**

```shell script
bombadil link
```

This command will do the following : 
- Remove `{dotfiles_dir}/.dots` and any symlink pointing to a sub directory/file.
- Inject variables (if you defined some) in a copy of dot entries listed in Bombadil config.
- Write the copies to `{dotfiles_dir}/.dots`.
- Symlink dot entries.
- Run post install hooks.

## Dotfile Templates

### Variables 

Now that your dot files are symlinked with Bombadil you can define some variables. 
A Bombadil var files is a valid toml file containing only key with string values : 

For example you have the following file in `{dotfiles_dir}/vars.toml`.

```toml
terminal = "alacritty"
background = "#292C3E"
foreground = "#EBEBEB"
text = "#FF261E"
cursor = "#FF261E"
black = "#0d0d0d"
red = "#FF301B"
green = "#A0E521"
yellow = "#FFC620"
blue = "#1BA6FA"
```

You can use the var file by adding the following to your Bombadil config : 
```toml
[settings]
vars = [ "vars.toml" ]
```

Let's say you have the following dot entry : 
```toml
[settings.dots]
alacritty = { source = "alacritty", target = ".config/alacritty/alacritty.yml" }
```

`alacritty.yaml` color scheme could look like this : 
```yaml
...
# {dotfiles}/alacritty.yml
colors:
   primary:
       background: "__[background]__"
       foreground: "__[foreground]__"
   cursor:
       text: "__[text]__"
       cursor: "__[cursor]__"
...
```

And the output file actually linked to alacritty config would be this :

```yaml
...
# {dotfiles}/.dots/alacritty.yml
colors:
  primary:
    background: "#292C3E"
    foreground: "#EBEBEB"
  cursor:
    text: "#FF261E"
    cursor: "#FF261E"
...
```

To update variables and the current config simply run `bombadil link`.

### Referencing variables 

Sometimes it could be handy to use different variables names for the same values.
For instance if you want to define a system wide color scheme, you could define the following variables references : 

```toml
# bombadil.toml
[settings]
vars = [ "vars.toml", "theme_vars.toml", "alacritty_vars.toml", "sway_vars.toml" ]
# ... 
```

By prefixing a variable value with `%` you tell bombadil to look for a variable reference.
Here `%red`, `%black` and `%green` will be replaced with the actual `red`, `black` and `green` values.

```toml
# theme_vars.toml
red = "#ff0000"
black = "#000000"
green = "#008000"
```

```toml
# sway_vars.toml
sway_client_focused_background = "%black"
sway_client_focused_border = "#ffff00"
# ...
```

```toml
# alacritty_vars.toml
alacritty_background = "%black"
alacritty_cursor = "%green"
# ...
```

## Switching profile

As we saw Bombadil allows to define global variables for all your dotfiles. For some programs you might want to 
set an alternate configuration.
Bombadil allow you two do this in two different way : by changing the source file linked against user configuration or 
by overriding variables only for this specific file.  

### Overriding dot entries

Let's say you are using [maven](https://maven.apache.org/) for several java projects, some of them are open source 
and some of them uses a corporate repository : 


let's assume your dotfiles are the following : 

```shell script
~/bombadil-example
❯ tree
.
├── bombadil.toml
└── maven
    ├── settings.corporate.xml
    └── settings.xml
```

Your bombadil config contains a single dot entry with an alternate profile : 

```toml
# bombadil.toml
dotfile_dir = "bombadil-example"
[settings.dots]
maven = { source = "maven/settings.xml", target = ".m2/settings.xml"}

[profiles.corporate.dots]
maven = { source = "maven/settings.corporate.xml" }
```

When defining dots under a profile section you can override a dot entry, in that case, `source` and `target` are optional
and the default profile value will be used if not specified. You can also define a new dot entry in which case `source`
and `target` are required. 

If you now run `bombadil link --help` you should notice a new profile value is available : 

```
USAGE:
    bombadil link

OPTIONS:
    -p, --profiles <PROFILES>...    A list of comma separated profiles to activate [possible values: corporate]
    -h, --help                      Prints help information
```

`bombadil link` would produce the following link : 
```shell script
❯ bombadil link
"/home/okno/dotfiles/.dots/maven/settings.xml" => "/home/okno/.m2/settings.xml"
```

Linking with the `corporate` profile would use the alternate source for `.m2/settings.xml` : 
```shell script
❯ bombadil link -p corporate
"/home/okno/dotfiles/.dots/maven/settings.corporate.xml" => "/home/okno/.m2/settings.xml"
```

### Adding variables 

Here is an example bombadil config : 

```shell script
~/bombadil-example
❯ tree
.
├── bashrc
├── bombadil.toml
├── java10-vars.toml
└── vars.toml
```

Adding or overriding variables can be done this way :

```toml
# bombadil.toml
dotfile_dir = "bombadil-example"
[settings]
vars = [ "vars.toml" ]

[settings.dots]
bashrc = { source = "bashrc", target = ".bashrc"}

[profiles.corporate]
vars = [ "java10-vars.toml" ]
``` 

```shell script
# ~/bombadil-example/bashrc
export JAVA_HOME=__[java_home]__
# ...
```

```shell script
# ~/bombadil-example/vars.toml
java_home = "/etc/java-openjdk"
# ...
```

```shell script
# ~/bombadil-example/java10-vars.toml
java_home = "/etc/java10-openjdk"
# ...
```

Running `bombadil link -p corporate` would produce the following `.bashrc` : 
```shell script
export JAVA_HOME=/etc/java10-openjdk
```

## Hooks

So far we have no talked about hooks, as we saw they can be invoked as an entry in the config : 

```toml
dotfiles_dir = "bombadil-example.toml"
[settings]
hooks = [ "sway reload" ]
```

This will invoke the `sway reload` command after `bombadil link` has updated your dotfiles.

The default hooks will always be run regardless of the activated profiles.
You can also add hooks for a specific profile.

```toml
dotfiles_dir = "bombadil-example.toml"

[settings]
# This reside in the default profile an will always be executed after bombadil link
hooks = [ "sway reload", "echo 42" ]

[profiles.corporate]
# This will only be executed when activating the `corporate` 
hooks = [ "echo \"Welcome to evil corp\"" ]
```

### Limitations

- Hook are run in a sub-shell therefore, *command meant to change your current shell environment won't work* :

```toml
hooks = [ "source /home/user/.zshrc" ] # This does not work ! 
```

- Environment variable won't be expanded unless you explicitly call a sub-shell : 

```toml
hooks = [ "echo $HOME" ] # This will print "$HOME"
```

```toml
hooks = [ "zsh -c \"echo $HOME\"" ] # This works
```
